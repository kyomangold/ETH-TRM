# Theory of Robotics and Mechatronics

This is the repository for the code files of the **Theory of Robotics and Mechatronics** lecture at the [Institute of Robotics and Intelligen Systems](https://www.iris.ethz.ch) and the [Multi-Scale Robotics Lab](https://msrl.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich taught by Dr. Sascha Stoeter and Dr. Petr Korba under Prof. Dr. Brad Nelson. The lecture covered the following topics

- Rigid motions
- Homogeneous transformations
- Forward and inverse kinematics of multiple degree of freedom manipulators
- Velocity kinematics
- Motion planning
- Trajectory generation
- Sensing
- Vision
- Control

The repository contains a folder with the code to the problem sets, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied.
